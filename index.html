                        <h2>'Never Cease'</h2>
                        <p>The expression is shorthand for a family saying of mine which says that "those who dare to
                            teach,
                            must never cease to learn. From an early age I remember seeing these words on an award that
                            my
                            grandfather had as a paperweight. For me, these words ring the truest when I myself am
                            reaching
                            beyond what I am comfortable and striving to better myself. Having spent the past 13 years
                            teaching in Title 1 school districts, I have benefited from the opertunities to continue my
                            education both through formal classes and colaboration with students, faculty, and community
                            stakeholders.
                        </p>
                        <p>With a trackrecord of sucess, I'm ready to start listening to your hopes and dreams helping

                            to unpack the 'how' and 'why' of your goals for the future.
